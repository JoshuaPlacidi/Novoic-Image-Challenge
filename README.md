# Novoic-Image-Challenge
 
This is my attempt at the Novoic Image Challenge. After anaylising the data and their distribution I implemented a convolutional neural network with the aim of predicting categories that feature in the image. The model perfoms reasonably well considering the size and distribution of the data, at the end of the Jupyter notebook file I have breifly stated actions I would take to increase the performance of the model.

Thank you for considering my application.
