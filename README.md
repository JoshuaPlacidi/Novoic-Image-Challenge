# Novoic-Image-Challenge
 
This is my attempt at the Novoic Image Challenge. After anaylising the data and their distribution I implemented a convolutional neural network with the aim of predicting categories that feature in an image. The implementation is contained in the Novoic_image_challenge.ipynb file.

The model perfoms reasonably well considering the size and distribution of the data, at the end of the Jupyter notebook file I have breifly stated actions I would take to increase performance.

Thank you for considering my application.
